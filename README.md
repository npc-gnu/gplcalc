This app is a very basic GPLv3 calc. It can do 4 basic math operations and take squareroot l
of a number.
# Installation

2. You can compile it by runnin `g++ -o hesap hesap.cpp`
Reason of this app i deleted Xiaomi's calc app from my phone so i wanted to write an free software calculator app from scratch to use it on termux.
But you can use it in your computer too.
And i will still going to add new features to thiss calc too.

Lastly: This app is %100 Turkish. I will make it English soon.
